# Task 1 : Data Quality Assessment
Here is the background information on task
**Sprocket Central Pty Ltd**, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in **KPMG’s** Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

However, in order to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director for some ideas and she advised that “the importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth.”

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

Customer Demographic ,
Customer Addresses ,
Transactions data in the past 3 months ,
I decide to start the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.
