# Task-2: Data Insights

This repository contains the project work for the customer analysis task assigned by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. The task involves analyzing a new list of 1000 potential customers without prior transaction history, with the goal of identifying high-value customers for targeted marketing. 

## Background Information

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is a renowned provider of high-quality bikes and cycling accessories. Their marketing team aims to optimize resource allocation and improve performance by gaining customer insights from the existing dataset. The project spans three weeks and consists of three phases: Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation.

## Task Description

The objective is to recommend which of the 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organization. To achieve this, a comprehensive approach will be developed, starting with a PowerPoint presentation outlining the strategy for each phase. The approach will encompass activities such as data understanding, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, results interpretation, and reporting. The presentation will be presented to the client for sign-off.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis and follow along, please ensure you have the following datasets available:
1. Customer demographic dataset
2. Customer address dataset
3. Transactions dataset

## Approach and Strategy

The analysis will involve exploring the data distributions, performing feature engineering, data transformations, and model development. The PowerPoint presentation will provide a detailed plan for each phase, including the strategy behind the activities involved. Additional external data from sources like the ABS/Census may be utilized to enrich the model.

## Notes and Tips

- Raw data fields may require transformation into calculated fields for modeling purposes (e.g., converting D.O.B to age or age groups).
- External data from the ABS/Census can be sourced to augment the model with additional variables.
